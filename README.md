# DB_Practice
This is an exercise to learn about building a DB and creating tables with Primary and foreign keys. The DB created is one that I made up for an imaginary toy company. This was meant to learn new skills for creating a Database and learning how it works as well as using it to practice some tableau techniques with the new DB. The database is called Myshop and is composed of 4 tables.



A description of the tables is as follows:


<br />

**client**:

  clientID(String): Primary key and the ID for each client in the DB.
  
  Company(String): The name fo the client.
  
  City(String): The city where the client company is located.
  
  Address(String): The address to the company where the products will shipped.


  <br />

**employee**:

  employeeID(String): Primary key and the our shops employee's ID. Note that these employees are all salesman.
  
  FirstName(String): Employees first name.
  
  LastName(String): Employees last name.
  
  Age(INT): Employees age.


  <br />

**wharehouse**:

  productID(String): Primary key and our products ID we use to identify what was sold to the clients.
  
  product_name(String): the name of the toy.
  
  price(float): the price of the toy.


  <br />

**orders**:

  orderID(String): Primary key and is the ID for an order put in for a client who is buying toys.
  
  units(INT): the quantity of the toy that the client wants.
  
  clientID(String): Foreign key from **client** using clientID and it is the ID of the client that is ordering toys.

The image above shows the ER Diagram of the tbales which are connected through foreign keys by each table to show the relationship of the tabes.
