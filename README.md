# DB_Practice
This is an exercise to learn about building a DB and creating tables with Primary and foreign keys. The DB created is one that I made up for an imaginary toy company. This was meant to learn new skills for creating a Database and learning how it works as well as using it to practice some tableau techniques with the new DB. The database is called Myshop and is composed of 4 tables.

A description of the tables is as follows:
